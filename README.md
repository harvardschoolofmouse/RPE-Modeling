>   Temporal Difference learning under state uncertainty with feedback:  Value function learning code was adapted from original code by John Mikhael (@jgmikhael). Dr. Mikhael's original code is included in the JMoriginalcode folder for comparison (<a href="https://github.com/jgmikhael/ramping">his latest GitHub version here</a>). Original derivation of this method is reported in <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(22)00036-7.pdf">Mikhael et al., 2022, Current Biology 32, 1077â€“1087</a>

## Dependencies

Runs on MATLAB 2023a+

## Getting started:

Running obj = CLASS_value_landscaping_obj will produce Figures 2 and 3 from the biorxiv manuscript. That's all you need to do! The uncertainty kernels will also display.
